## To Run The Project
Within the top level directory run the following commands:
```shell
./install.sh
```

```shell
./setup.sh
```

```shell
./run.sh
```

If any of them fail you may need to run:
```shell
chmod u+x ./install.sh ./run.sh ./setup.sh
```

You may also need to install `psql` on your command line, and ensure you have a PostgreSQL server running.
